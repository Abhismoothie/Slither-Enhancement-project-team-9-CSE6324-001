# Slither-Enhancement-project-team-9-CSE6324-001

This is final github repository containing all the files and code from 1st to the final iteration.

Project Introduction:

The Proposal is to enhance the Slither Framework Analysis by adding a functionality to handle nested structs. It provides fine-grained information about smart contract codes and has the necessary flexibility to support many applications. Enabling support for nested structs in Slither would expand its capabilities, allowing users to analyze a wider array of Solidity smart contracts for potential security vulnerabilities. This enhancement would also bolster Slither's effectiveness by increasing its thoroughness and precision in evaluating Solidity code.

**Step-by-step process for installing Python and Slither on Ubuntu:**

1.  Update the package manager:

```
sudo apt update

```

2.  Install Python 3:

```
sudo apt install python3

```

3.  Install Pip, the Python package manager:

```
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip

```

4.  Install Slither:

```
pip3 install slither-analyzer

```

**Step-by-step process for installing Hardhat on Ubuntu:**

1.  Install Node.js:

```
sudo apt install nodejs

```

2.  Install Hardhat:

```
npm install-save-dev hardhat

```

3.  Initialize a new Hardhat project:

```
npx hardhat init

```

4.  Install the @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox package:

```
npm install-save dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox 100

```

**To verify that the installation was successful, you can run the following commands:**

```
python3 --version

```

```
pip3 --version

```

```
slither --version

```

```
hardhat version

```

If all of the commands return valid versions, then the installation was successful.
